# ♟️ Chess Game (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

A fully functional browser-based Chess game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** (94% Vanilla JS). This project allows two players to play a standard chess match directly in the browser without any third-party libraries.

## 🚀 Features

* ♔ Standard 8x8 Chessboard
* ♞ All chess pieces with standard movements
* ⚖️ Basic rule enforcement (e.g., legal moves, check/checkmate)
* 🔁 Move validation and turn-based logic
* ✨ Interactive UI with responsive design
* 🧠 Pure Vanilla JavaScript implementation (No frameworks/libraries)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Structure and layout
* **CSS3** – Styling and animations
* **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Game logic, move handling, event listeners

## 📂 Project Structure

```bash
📁 chess-game/
├── index.html       # Main HTML file
├── style.css        # Styling and layout
├── script.js        # Core game logic
└── assets/          # Optional folder for piece icons or images
```

## 🧩 How It Works

* Initializes an 8x8 board and populates pieces in standard layout.
* Each move is validated based on the piece's logic.
* Handles turn switching, captures, and basic win conditions.
* UI updates dynamically to reflect moves and board state.

## 📦 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chess-game.git

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
